Bug: Difference in total mass in a zone containing is is not equal to SUM(fluxes)


caused by:
    ommitting "icevolfactor(i,season)" in the calculation of umatrix

Solved by adding "* icevolfactor(i,season)" to the calculation of umatrix


Aktueller Code

if vol(6,i+1) ~= 0 && icevolfactor(i,season) ~=   0
	if SizeDif	
 		umatrix(6,3,2,subs) = (phiFine(season,i,subs) * v36dryFine + phiCoarse(season,i,subs) * v36dryCoarse) * vol(3,i+1)/(vol(6,i+1) * icevolfactor(i,season));
 		umatrix(6,3,4,subs) = (phiFine(season,i,subs) * v36wetFine + phiCoarse(season,i,subs) * v36wetCoarse) * vol(3,i+1)/(vol(6,i+1) * icevolfactor(i,season));
 	else
 		umatrix(6,3,2,subs) = (phi(season,i,subs) * v36dry * vol(3,i+1))/(vol(6,i+1) * icevolfactor(i,season));           % air --> ice:  par.dep.dry  Missing 
 		umatrix(6,3,4,subs) = (phi(season,i,subs) * v36wet * vol(3,i+1))/(vol(6,i+1) * icevolfactor(i,season));            % air --> ice: par.dep.wet
 	end
 	umatrix(6,3,1,subs) = ((1-phi(season,i,subs)) * v36diff * vol(3,i+1))/(vol(6,i+1) * icevolfactor(i,season));      % air --> ice: diff.out
        umatrix(6,3,3,subs) = ((1-phi(season,i,subs)) * v36rain * vol(3,i+1))/(vol(6,i+1) * icevolfactor(i,season));      % air --> ice: gas.dep.wet
        
        

Bug: 		mass of chemical in vegetation snow or ice is over/underestimated (while concentration is correct)
		When CalcFluxFlag == True

caused by: 	Adaption of media volumes to the new season in dynamike before the masses for the old season are calculated

Solved by:	moving the following Code out of dynamike, and behind makefluxvtab, makefluxetab and calcflux.
